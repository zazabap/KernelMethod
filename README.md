# C++ Kernel Methods for Support Vector Machines

This repository contains examples and utilities for implementing kernel methods, particularly for Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in C++ using the LightSVM library. The code demonstrates how to load datasets, preprocess data, train SVM models, and make predictions using various kernel functions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/kernel-methods-cpp.git
    cd kernel-methods-cpp
    ```

2. **Install LightSVM:**

    Download and install the LightSVM library from [LightSVM website](https://lightsvm.github.io/). Ensure that you have the necessary header files and library binaries.

3. **Adjust CMakeLists.txt:**

    Update the paths in the `CMakeLists.txt` file to point to the LightSVM library and header directories on your system.

4. **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

## Usage

### Dataset Preparation

Prepare your dataset in a format compatible with LightSVM. Ensure your dataset is split into features and labels.

### Training a Model

1. Modify `main.cpp` to load your dataset and convert it into the required format for LightSVM.

2. Choose the kernel type and set the SVM parameters according to your requirements.

3. Train the SVM model using the prepared dataset.

### Making Predictions

Use the trained model to make predictions on new data points. Ensure the new data is processed in the same way as the training data.

## Examples

The repository provides examples with simple datasets to illustrate how to use kernel methods with LightSVM. Check the `examples/` directory for these demonstrations.
